== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= AdS by BestWebSoft plugin installed, but it does not appear in the list of plugins in the Wordpress admin dashboard. Why? =

It is possible that you have AdBlock browser extension (or similar software) installed in your browser and it blocks ads. Disable AdBlock extension to see the AdS by BestWebSoft plugin and make necessary changes.

= AdS by BestWebSoft plugin doesn't work (ads not displaying). What should I do? =

Please complete the following steps:
1. Setup your Google Adsense account.
2. Make sure that your Wordpress theme contains necessary hooks for ads displaying (the_content, wp_footer, etc). If you don't know how to check that, just install any official Wordpress theme (for example, [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/)) and check if the ads are displayed. If yes, it means that the necessary hooks are missing in your theme.
3. Make sure Adblock (or similar browser extensions) is disabled in your browser.

= How to add Google Adsense block to the sidebar? =

Follow the next steps in order to add the Google Adsense block to the sidebar:
1. Open your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Make sure that AdS by BestWebSoft plugin is installed and activated.
3. Navigate to the Appearance > Widgets section and add the AdS by BestWebSoft widget to the available sidebar.
